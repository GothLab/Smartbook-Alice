## XI. THE QUEEN’S GARDEN.

This is a little bit of the beautiful garden I told you about. You see Alice had managed at last to get quite small, so that she could go through the little door. I suppose she was about as tall as a mouse, if it stood on its hind-legs: so of course this was a _very_ tiny rose-tree: and these are _very_ tiny gardeners.

What funny little men they are! But _are_ they men, do you think? I think they must be live cards, with just a head, and arms, and legs, so as to _look_ like little men. And what _are_ they doing with that red paint, I wonder? Well, you see, this is what they told Alice The Queen of Hearts wanted to have a _red_ rose-tree just in that corner: and these poor little gardeners had made a great mistake, and had put in a _white_ one instead: and they were so frightened about it, because the Queen was _sure_ to be angry, and then she would order all their heads to be cut off!

She was a dreadfully savage Queen, and that was the way she always did, when she was angry with people. “Off with their heads!” They didn’t _really_ cut their heads off, you know: because nobody ever obeyed her: but that was what she always _said_.

_Now_ ca’n’t you guess what the poor little gardeners are trying to do? They’re trying to paint the roses _red_, and they’re in a great hurry to get it done before the Queen comes. And then _perhaps_ the Queen won’t find out it was a _white_ rose-tree to begin with: and then _perhaps_ the little men won’t get their heads cut off!

You see there were _five_ large white roses on the tree——such a job to get them all painted red! But they’ve got three and a half done, now, and if only they wouldn’t stop to talk——work away, little men, _do_ work away! Or the Queen will be coming before it’s done! And if she finds any _white_ roses on the tree, do you know what will happen? It will be “Off with their heads!” Oh, work away, my little men! Hurry, hurry!

_The Queen has come!_ And _isn’t_ she angry? Oh, my poor little Alice!
