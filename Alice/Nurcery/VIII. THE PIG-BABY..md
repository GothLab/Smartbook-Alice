## VIII. THE PIG-BABY.

Would you like to hear about Alice’s visit to the Duchess? It was a very interesting visit indeed, I can assure you.

Of course she knocked at the door to begin with: but nobody came: so she had to open it for herself.

Now, if you look at the picture, you’ll see exactly what Alice saw when she got inside.

The door led right into the kitchen, you see. The Duchess sat in the middle of the room, nursing the Baby. The Baby was howling. The soup was boiling. The Cook was stirring the soup. The Cat——it was a _Cheshire_ Cat——was grinning, as Cheshire Cats always do. All these things were happening just as Alice went in.

The Duchess has a beautiful cap and gown, hasn’t she? But I’m afraid she _hasn’t_ got a very beautiful _face_.

The Baby——well, I daresay you’ve seen _several_ nicer babies than _that_: and more good-tempered ones, too. However, take a good look at it, and we’ll see if you know it again, next time you meet it!

The Cook——well, you _may_ have seen nicer cooks, once or twice.

But I’m nearly sure you’ve _never_ seen a nicer _Cat_! Now _have_ you? And _wouldn’t_ you like to have a Cat of your own, just like that one, with lovely green eyes, and smiling so sweetly?

The Duchess was very rude to Alice. And no wonder. Why, she even called her own _Baby_ “Pig!” And it _wasn’t_ a Pig, _was_ it? And she ordered the Cook to chop off Alice’s head: though of course the Cook didn’t do it: and at last she threw the Baby at her! So Alice caught the Baby, and took it away with her: and I think that was about the best thing she could do.

So she wandered away, through the wood, carrying the ugly little thing with her. And a great job it was to keep hold of it, it wriggled about so. But at last she found out that the _proper_ way was, to keep tight hold of its left foot and its right ear.

But don’t _you_ try to hold on to a Baby like that, my Child! There are not many babies that _like_ being nursed in _that_ way!

Well, and so the Baby kept grunting, and grunting so that Alice had to say to it, quite seriously, “If you’re going to turn into a _Pig_, my dear, I’ll have nothing more to do with you. Mind now!”

And at last she looked down into its face, and what _do_ you think had happened to it? Look at the picture, and see if you can guess.

“Why, _that’s_ not the Baby that Alice was nursing, is it?”

Ah, I _knew_ you wouldn’t know it again, though I told you to take a good look at it! Yes, it _is_ the Baby. And it’s turned into a little _Pig_!

So Alice put it down, and let it trot away into the wood. And she said to herself “It was a _very_ ugly _Baby_: but it makes rather a handsome _Pig_, I think.”

Don’t you think she was right?
