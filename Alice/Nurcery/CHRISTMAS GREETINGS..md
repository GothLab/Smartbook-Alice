## CHRISTMAS GREETINGS.

(_FROM A FAIRY TO A CHILD._)

*Lady dear, if Fairies may For a moment lay aside Cunning tricks and elfish play, ’Tis at happy Christmas-tide.

_We have heard the children say— Gentle children, whom we love— Long ago, on Christmas Day, Came a message from above._

_Still, as Christmas-tide comes round, They remember it again— Echo still the joyful sound “Peace on earth, good-will to men!”_

_Yet the hearts must childlike be Where such heavenly guests abide: Unto children, in their glee, All the year is Christmas-tide!_

_Thus, forgetting tricks and play For a moment, Lady dear, We would wish you, if we may, Merry Christmas, glad New Year!_
