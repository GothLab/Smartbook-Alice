## XIV. THE SHOWER OF CARDS.

Oh dear, oh dear! What _is_ it all about? And what’s happening to Alice?

Well, I’ll tell you all about it, as well I can. The way the trial ended was this. The King wanted the Jury to settle whether the Knave of Hearts was _guilty_ or _not guilty_——that means that they were to settle whether _he_ had stolen the Tarts, or if somebody else had taken them. But the wicked _Queen_ wanted to have his _punishment_ settled, first of all. That wasn’t at all fair, _was_ it? Because, you know, supposing he never _took_ the Tarts, then of course he oughtn’t to be punished. Would _you_ like to be punished for something you hadn’t done?

So Alice said “Stuff and nonsense!”

So the Queen said “Off with her head!” (Just what she always said, when she was angry.)

So Alice said “Who cares for _you_? You’re nothing but a pack of cards!”

So they were _all_ very angry, and flew up into the air, and came tumbling down again, all over Alice, just like a shower of rain.

And I think you’ll _never_ guess what happened next. The next thing was, Alice woke up out of her curious dream. And she found that the cards were only some leaves off the tree, that the wind had blown down upon her face.

_Wouldn’t_ it be a nice thing to have a curious dream, just like Alice?

The best plan is this. First lie down under a tree, and wait till a White Rabbit runs by, with a watch in his hand: then shut your eyes, and pretend to be dear little Alice.

Good-bye, Alice dear, good-bye!

THE END.
