## VI. THE DEAR LITTLE PUPPY.

Well, it doesn’t look such a very _little_ Puppy, does it? But then, you see, Alice had grown very small indeed: and _that’s_ what makes the Puppy look so large. When Alice had eaten one of those little magic cakes, that she found in the White Rabbit’s house, it made her get quite small, directly, so that she could get through the door: or else she could _never_ have got out of the house again. Wouldn’t _that_ have been a pity? Because then she wouldn’t have dreamed all the other curious things that we’re going to read about.

So it really _was_ a _little_ Puppy, you see. And isn’t it a little _pet_? And look at the way it’s barking at the little stick that Alice is holding out for it! You can see she was a _little_ afraid of it, all the time, because she’s got behind that great thistle, for fear it should run over her. That would have been just about as bad, for _her_, as it would be for _you_ to be run over by a waggon and four horses!

Have you got a little pet puppy at _your_ home? If you have, I hope you’re always kind to it, and give it nice things to eat.

Once upon a time, I knew some little children, about as big as you; and they had a little pet dog of their own; and it was called _Dash_. And this is what they told me about its birthday-treat.

“Do you know, one day we remembered it was Dash’s birthday that day. So we said ‘Let’s give Dash a nice birthday-treat, like what we have on _our_ birthdays!’ So we thought and we thought ‘Now, what is it _we_ like best of all, on _our_ birthdays?’ And we thought and we thought. And at last we all called out together “Why, its _oatmeal-porridge_, of course!” So of course we thought Dash would be _quite_ sure to like it very much, too.

“So we went to the cook, and we got her to make a saucerful of nice oatmeal-porridge. And then we called Dash into the house, and we said ‘Now, Dash, you’re going to have your birthday-treat!’ We expected Dash would jump for joy: but it didn’t, one bit!

“So we put the saucer down before it, and we said ‘Now, Dash, don’t be greedy! Eat it nicely, like a good dog!’

“So Dash just tasted it with the tip of its tongue: and then it made, oh, such a horrid face! And then, do you know, it did _hate_ it so, it wouldn’t eat a bit more of it! So we had to put it all down its throat with a spoon!”

I wonder if Alice will give _this_ little Puppy some porridge? I don’t think she _can_, because she hasn’t got any with her. I can’t see any saucer in the picture.
