## XII. THE LOBSTER-QUADRILLE.

Did you ever play at Croquet? There are large wooden balls, painted with different colours, that you have to roll about; and arches of wire, that you have to send them through; and great wooden mallets, with long handles, to knock the balls about with.

Now look at the picture, and you’ll see that _Alice_ has just been playing a Game of Croquet.

“But she _couldn’t_ play, with that great red what’s-its-name in her arms! Why, how could she hold the mallet?”

Why, my dear Child, that great red what’s-its-name (its _real_ name is “_a Flamingo_”) _is_ the mallet! In this Croquet-Game, the balls were live _Hedge-hogs_——you know a hedge-hog can roll itself up into a ball?——and the mallets were live _Flamingos_!

So Alice is just resting from the Game, for a minute, to have a chat with that dear old thing, the Duchess: and of course she keeps her mallet under her arm, so as not to lose it.

“But I don’t think she _was_ a dear old thing, one bit! To call her Baby a _Pig_, and to want to chop off Alice’s head!”

Oh, that was only a joke, about chopping off Alice’s head: and as to the Baby——why, it _was_ a Pig, you know! And just look at her _smile_! Why, it’s wider than all Alice’s head: and yet you can only see half of it!

Well, they’d only had a _very_ little chat, when the Queen came and took Alice away, to see the Gryphon and the Mock Turtle.

_You don’t know what a Gryphon is?_ Well! Do you know _anything_? That’s the question. However, look at the picture. That creature with a red head, and red claws, and green scales, is the _Gryphon_. Now you know.

And the other’s the _Mock Turtle_. It’s got a calf’s-head, because calf’s head is used to make _Mock Turtle Soup_. Now you know.

“But what are they _doing_, going round and round Alice like that?”

Why, I thought of _course_ you’d know _that_! They’re dancing _a Lobster-Quadrille_.

And next time _you_ meet a Gryphon and a Mock Turtle, I daresay they’ll dance it for _you_, if you ask them prettily. Only don’t let them come _quite_ close, or they’ll be treading on your toes, as they did on poor Alice’s.
