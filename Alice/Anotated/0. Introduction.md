## Introduction

_All in the golden afternoon_  
_Full leisurely we glide;_  
_For both our oars, with little skill,_  
_By little arms are plied,_  
_While little hands make vain pretence_  
_Our wanderings to guide._

Ah, cruel Three! _In such an hour_  
_Beneath such dreamy weather,_  
_To beg a tale of breath too weak_  
_To stir the tiniest feather!_  
_Yet what can one poor voice avail_  
_Against three tongues together?_

_Imperious_ Prima _flashes forth_  
_Her edict 'to begin it' —_  
_In gentler tone_ Secunda _hopes_  
_'There will be nonsense in it!' —_  
_While_ Tertia _interrupts the tale_  
_Not more than once a minute._

_Anon, to sudden silence won,_  
_In fancy they pursue_  
_The dream-child moving through a land_  
_Of wonders wild and new,_  
_In friendly chat with bird or beast —_  
_And half believe it true._

_And ever, as the story drained_  
_The wells of fancy dry,_  
_And faintly strove_ that weary one  
_To put the subject by,_  
_"The rest next time—" "It is next time!"_  
_The happy voices cry._

_Thus grew the tale of Wonderland:_  
_Thus slowly, one by one,_  
_Its quaint events were hammered out —_  
_And now the tale is done_  
_,And home we steer, a merry crew,_  
_Beneath the setting sun._

_Alice! a childish story take,_  
_And with a gentle hand_  
_Lay it where Childhood’s dreams are twined_  
_In Memory’s mystic band,_  
_Like pilgrim’s wither’d wreath of flowers_  
_Pluck’d in a far-off land._
