## POSTSCRIPT

_The profits, if any, of this book will be given to Children's Hospitals and Convalescent Homes for Sick Children; and the accounts, down to June 30 in each year, will be published in the St. James's Gazette, on the second Tuesday of the following December._

_P.P.S.—The thought, so prettily expressed by the little boy, is also to be found in Longfellow's "Hiawatha," where he appeals to those who believe_

"_That the feeble hands and helpless,__Groping blindly in the darkness_,_Touch_ God's _right hand in that darkness_,_And are lifted up and strengthened_."
